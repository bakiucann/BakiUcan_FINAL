`myTunesApp` is a highly dynamic and user-friendly music search application crafted in Swift. The application permits users to search for their beloved songs and include them in their favorite list. This application exhibits a well-structured VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router) architecture to ensure an organized, maintainable, and testable codebase.

## Features


**1. Song Search:** Enables users to explore their favorite tracks using the search functionality.

**2. Favorites Management:** Users can effortlessly add their desired songs to a favorites list for future access.

**3. Detailed Song View:** Users can access comprehensive details about their favorite songs.

**4. Continuous Playback:** The app supports uninterrupted playback of the selected songs.

**5. Intuitive UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface that is extremely easy to navigate and visually pleasing.

## Project Architecture

The architecture of the project adheres to the VIPER design pattern to ensure a high degree of separation of concerns, leading to a more manageable and scalable application.

- **View:** Displays what it is told to by the Presenter and relays user input back to the Presenter.
- **Interactor:** Contains the business logic as specified by a use case.
- **Presenter:** Contains view logic for preparing content for display and for reacting to user inputs.
- **Entity:** Contains basic model objects used by the Interactor.
- **Router:** Contains navigation logic for describing which screens are shown in which order.

## Testing

`myTunesApp` incorporates a robust suite of unit and UI tests, ensuring that the application is reliable and offers a high-quality user experience.

- **Unit Tests:** The unit tests are designed to evaluate individual components in isolation, including the Interactor and Presenter.
- **UI Tests:** The UI tests simulate user interactions with the application and verify the application's appropriate response.
